I hold a master's degree in math and computer sciences applied to biology from Sorbonne University in Paris. Having discovered C++ programming as a child, I am actively involved in open-source communities. My previous commercial experience includes working in 3D Graphics and Runtime design with Rust, Nix, and Haskell. I have taught Systems Programming, Architecture, and DevOps to master‚Äôs students and have designed algorithm competitions and kids/teens coding workshops, where I assist them in building small video games. Currently residing in Belgium, I enjoy biking, hiking, climbing, and vegan cooking.

## Current commercial work

I am currently working as a Senior DevX Engineer at IOG, contributing to Rust, Nix, and Haskell upstream tooling. I designed the Rust/Haskell interoperability tools suite [`cargo-cabal`](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/cargo-cabal) and [`hs-bindgen`](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/hs-bindgen), the Nix [`contracts`](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/contracts) library, and am maintaining the [`Cabal`](https://github.com/haskell/cabal), [`devx`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/devx) and [`haskell.nix`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix) build infrastructures.

## Notes on my personal setup

As a [Nix(OS)](https://nixos.org/) enthusiast, you can explore my cherished [Thinkpad X230 (and iMac M1) configuration](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/X230). My `~` is managed by [@rycee](https://github.com/rycee) [`home-manager`](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) both on NixOS and macOS, relying on [`nix-darwin`](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) by [@LnL7](https://github.com/LnL7) to maintain a declarative setup.

Before transitioning to [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org) using [Sway](https://swaywm.org/) and [@emersion](https://wayland.emersion.fr/) tools, I was an [xmonad](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/xmonad) user. Explore this [custom macOS port using X11](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/osxmonad) by [@puffnfresh](https://github.com/puffnfresh) and my [`xmonad.hs`](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/xmonad-config) configuration borrowed from [@andreivolt](https://twitter.com/andreivolt). You can also find my [old dotfiles](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/dotfiles) from the time I used [Xorg](https://www.x.org/wiki/) with `dwm` and `st` from [suckless](https://suckless.org/).

My code editor is [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and I use ZSH with [Grml configuration](https://grml.org/zsh/). I daily use [@zx2c4](https://www.zx2c4.com/) [`pass`](https://www.passwordstore.org/) on all my devices, having migrated from the Apple keychain data silo using [this script](https://github.com/yvan-sraka/keychain).
